# UFO

In this module, I create a table to organize UFO data that is stored as a JavaScript array, or list. This table will have the ability to filter data based on certain criteria and will be created using JavaScript as the primary coding language.

## Overview of Project: 

A request from a client to create a dynamic website that displays tabular information on UFO sightings data stored as a JavaScript array. They would like the ability to filter the data based on multiple criteria selected by the visitor. This filterable data table was created using JavaScript, while HTML/CSS and Bootstrap were used to modify and stylize the dynamic website. 

## Results: 

(Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.)

## Summary: 

(In a summary statement, describe one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development.)
