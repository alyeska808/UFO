# UFO

In this module, I will create a table to organize UFO data that is stored as a JavaScript array. This table will have the ability to filter data based on certain criteria and will be created using JavaScript as the primary coding language.

## Overview of Project: 

A request from a client to create a dynamic website that displays tabular information on UFO sightings data stored as a JavaScript array. They would like the capacity to filter the data based on multiple criteria selected by the website visitor. This data table was created using JavaScript, with HTML/CSS and Bootstrap used to modify and stylize the website. 

## Results: 

(Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.)

## Summary: 

The user must input exact dates, cities, and/or shapes for the search to display proper results. The filter requires the exact spellings and is lower-case sensitive. For example, searching El Cajon must be entered as el cajon. Spaces at the end of the text are also not recongized. 

One recommendation is to create coding that allows for looser restrictions on the filter. Such as mispellings, spaces at the end of text, and not case sensitive. Another recommendation would to allow for the filter to cast "a date net" when a user enters a specific date that is null of data to display.
